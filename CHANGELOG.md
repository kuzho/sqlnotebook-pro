# Change Log

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-22
- **⏱️ Execution Timestamp:** Added a clock to the results toolbar to show exactly when the query finished running.
- **🐛 Bug Fix:** Fixed "Columns require an id" error in the interactive grid when using columns with special characters.
- **🧹 UI Cleanup:** Removed the redundant "Connect" button from the sidebar (connections are now managed exclusively by the Notebook Kernel).

## v1.0.0 - 2025-12-20

- Initial release of SQL Notebook Pro.

### Major Features
- **Multi-Kernel Architecture:** Replaced the single global connection model with a true Notebook Kernel system. Now you can switch between different database connections directly from the Notebook toolbar (top right), just like switching Python kernels.
- **Connection Grouping:** Added support for organizing connections into folders/groups in the side panel.
- **Edit Connections:** Added "Edit Connection" option to the context menu. You can now modify host, user, or groups without deleting and recreating the connection.
- **Smart Password Handling:** When editing a connection, leaving the password field empty preserves the existing secure password.

### UI Improvements
- **Interactive Data Grid:**
  - **Excel-Style Filtering:** Completely redesigned column filters with search, multi-select checkboxes, and "Select All" functionality.
  - **Dynamic Height:** The result table now auto-adjusts its height to fit the content, up to a maximum scrollable height.
  - **Floating Menus:** Fixed issues where menus were clipped by cell boundaries using React Portals.
  - **Improved Sorting:** Clicking the column header name sorts the data, while clicking the empty space selects the column.
- **Hot Reload:** Connection configuration changes (like updating a password) now apply immediately to the next query without requiring a VS Code restart.

### Internal
- Updated minimum VS Code engine requirement to `^1.75.0`.
- Refactored `renderer` and `controller` for better performance and stability.
